### **Adds bird people**


**Might want to read the tips section at the bottom**

The Harpies are a neolithic race that are limited in their technological advancements by their constant fighting among themselves and tendency to pick fights with anyone, even stronger foes.

They have wings and large ears, appear otherwise human however. They are much lighter than a human due to hollow bones and different physique, allowing them to fly short distances. It also makes them much faster and they can skip over difficult terrain.

Their claws are razor sharp and make them deadly in melee. Keeping your distance will not save you however, as many harpies have the ability to throw orbs of lightning. Some scientists believed these powers could be improved upon with implants.

While being as versatile as humans when it comes to most forms of work they rely on their claws and lightning attacks for defense as they are incapable of wielding any type of weapon. And despite their beauty their need to fight will make them somewhat hard to integrate into a working colony, especially with other harpies around.

**WARNING:** They are a fairly challenging race. Their lack of joy and easy food buffs makes them hard to keep happy. Bloodlust as new need is brutal if not managed, as low bloodlust can lead to them going berserk, which is an extreme mental break. Beware.
To manage Bloodlust allow them to attack any pawn (animal or humanoid) regularly. You can use prisoners, your own colonists or hunting, if you aren't attacked.

Advantages:


-  Increased melee hit and dodge
-  Fast, powerful melee attacks
-  Natural ranged attack
-  1.0 Beauty base 
-  Very fast
-  Ignores path cost when wings are functioning
-  Can fly across any terrain from time to time
-  Claws can be easily upgraded with steel or plasteel
-  Lightning amplifiers allows upgrading ranged attack
-  Have no need for joy
-  Simple, human diet
-  Ignore the burn from chilis



Disadvantages:


-  New need: Bloodlust
-  High social fight chance
-  High abrasiveness
-  Double outdoor need
-  Low carrying capacity
-  Lose their terrain ignoring ability and fly ability when wings are hurt too much (or lost)
-  Require relatively warm temperature
-  Cannot use any weapon
-  90% female rate
-  Do not get mood buffs from eating fancy food
-  Instead require chili, human meat or a combination to raise their mood
-  Adding prosthetic arms will not restore wings
-  Replacing natural arms with prosthetics will leave them without wings
-  Require seperate wing prosthetics
-  Hand and food wear (doesnt exist in vanilla) will not fit over their claws
-  No fun at parties



**A few tips:**


-  Bloodlust can be managed by attacking any pawn
-  Chilis and human meat restore a little bloodlust
-  Lavish harpy meals can negate most bloodlust alone
-  Harpies need 50% combined wing capacity to ignore terrain and use their fly ability
-  Do not let non-harpies eat chilis or they will be downed from pain
-  Not even as ingredient
-  You can add claw and wing prosthetics even onto other prosthetics
-  Let harpies butcher humans, they always ignore the negative thought
-  They basically have the bloodlust trait baked into them, they also don't mind corpses



**https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2024059141]Crossover**
This mod will allow you to have mixed colonies or tribes with all my race mods. It comes with two scenarios as well.

Incompatible with:
**Lost Forest**
Should be fixed. Let me know.
**NewRatkinPlus**
AdditonalVerb framework causes endless NREs when you try to use fly ability. Either don't use fly or uninstall Ratkin.
